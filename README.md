# Statisical tests and methods

This is a collection of statistical tests and methods self-written as university projects in the R language. You can find here typical statistical tests as well as methods used e.g. in survival analysis, such as:
*   Student's *t*-test,
*   one-way ANalaysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) - with the implementation of Tukey's HSD test,
*   linear regression using the least squares method,
*   survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
